In order to recreate the binaries similar as placed in ../bin/arm_light.tgz, one needs to install the tool-chain using installToolChain2009_nocompile.sh. This install scratchbox2 en qemu, which is needed to compile the dependencies for gstreamer. 
After that download and compile the sources using either installFramework_0.10_lightextreme_x86.sh for a slimmed down package or installFramework_0.10_full_x86.sh + installFFMPEG.sh for the full package with all options and extra's enabled (including opencv, qr code detection, extra software video encoders, etc). The full package will not fit on the ARDrone2, so an external usb stick is necessary.
